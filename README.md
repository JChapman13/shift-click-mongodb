## Lessons Learned

If you ever wondered what it would be like to have a non-relational database, host traditionally relational database data? Well look no further, because I ventured down that nightmare path. The big takeaway from this whole experience is the different ways you can manipulate data.

## Roadmap

- Finish the functionality of populating a schedule

- Adding the functionality of availability for the employees

- Finishing the styling to make it more polished

- Add front page of quickview for the current day and employees scheduled.
